## 📁 Repository Structure

### **Week 1: Foundations of Linear Algebra & NumPy**

This week establishes the mathematical and coding foundations required for deep learning, along with an introduction to Kaggle-style machine learning workflows.

#### Key Topics Covered:
- **Linear Algebra**: Importance in ML, vectors as points and directions, linear transformations, and geometric meaning of matrices
- **NumPy & PyTorch Basics**: Tensor creation, shapes, indexing, slicing, broadcasting, and basic operations
- **Distance Computations**: Efficient vectorized distance matrix calculations and optimization techniques
- **Kaggle Introduction**: Understanding competitions, datasets (train.csv, test.csv), submission workflows, and exploration of the Titanic dataset

#### Files Included:
- Jupyter notebooks with practical examples and implementations
- Distance computation scripts for efficient numerical operations
- Kaggle competition preparation materials

**Note**: Some datasets are not included due to GitHub size limitations.

### **Week 2: Neural Networks & Backpropagation**

This week focuses on understanding the theoretical foundations and practical building blocks of neural networks.

#### Key Topics Covered:
- **Perceptron**: Linear binary classifier, role of weights/bias, activation functions, and limitations
- **XOR Problem**: Why single-layer perceptrons fail, motivation for multi-layer networks, geometric intuition
- **Multi-Layer Neural Networks (MLPs)**: Hidden layers, non-linear activations, learning complex boundaries
- **Backpropagation**: Core learning algorithm, chain rule for gradients, weight/bias updates, mathematical foundations

**Note**: Week 2 focused on theoretical learning with interactive materials. No formal coding assignments were completed, but conceptual understanding is emphasized.
