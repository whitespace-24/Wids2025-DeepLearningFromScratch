### **Week 2: Neural Networks & Backpropagation**

This week focuses on understanding the theoretical foundations and practical building blocks of neural networks.

#### Key Topics Covered:
- **Perceptron**: Linear binary classifier, role of weights/bias, activation functions, and limitations
- **XOR Problem**: Why single-layer perceptrons fail, motivation for multi-layer networks, geometric intuition
- **Multi-Layer Neural Networks (MLPs)**: Hidden layers, non-linear activations, learning complex boundaries
- **Backpropagation**: Core learning algorithm, chain rule for gradients, weight/bias updates, mathematical foundations

**Note**: Week 2 focused on theoretical learning with interactive materials. No formal coding assignments were completed, but conceptual understanding is emphasized.

## Week 3: Transitioning to Image Data with CNNs

In this week, the repository explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are specifically optimized for computer vision tasks such as handwritten digit recognition.

### Context
Similar to the previous K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) implementation, this project uses the MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 handwritten digit images of size 28x28 pixels.

### Pre-processing
- Images are treated as 2D grids (28x28 pixels) rather than flattened vectors.
- Unlike basic Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), CNNs preserve spatial structure, allowing the model to learn meaningful local patterns such as edges, curves, and shapes.

### Key CNN Components Implemented

To understand how spatial features are captured, the following core CNN concepts are emphasized:

#### Convolutional Layers (Conv2D)
- Use filters (kernels) that slide across the image instead of fully connected weights
- Learn local patterns such as edges, loops, and curves
- Employ parameter sharing, which significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters
- Preserve spatial relationships within the image

#### Pooling Layers (MaxPool)
- Perform down-sampling by selecting the maximum value in local windows (e.g., 2x2)
- Reduce computational complexity
- Introduce translation invariance, making feature detection robust to small shifts or distortions

### Implementation (Week 3)

## Project (Weeks 4 and 5): CNN from Scratch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST digit classification, where the core convolution and pooling operations are implemented from scratch, instead of using PyTorch’s built-in nn.Conv2d and nn.MaxPool2d.

The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of CNNs while still leveraging PyTorch for automatic differentiation and optimization.
